# Abstract
[abstract]: #abstract

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Introduction
[introduction]: #introduction

Background and purpose. Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support?
What is the expected outcome?

# Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it already existed and you were teaching it to
another extension developer. That generally means:

*   Introducing new named concepts.
*   Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
*   Explaining how extension programmers should *think* about the feature, and
    how it should impact the way they use PGXN. It should explain the impact
    as concretely as possible.
*   If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
    migration guidance.
*   If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing
    extension programmers and new extension programmers.
*   Discuss how this impacts the ability to develop, build and distribute
    extension packages.

# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient
detail that:

*    Its interaction with other features is clear.
*    It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
*    Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and
explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

*    Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
*    What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
     choosing them?
*    What is the impact of not doing this?

# Prior art
[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A
few examples of what this can include are:

*    For service and tools proposals: Does this feature exist in other
     packaging and distribution systems and what experience have their
     community had?
*    For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what
     were their experiences with it?
*    What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?
*    Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this?
     If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more
     detailed theoretical background.

This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the
lessons from other ecosystems, provide readers of your RFC with a fuller
picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine --- your ideas are interesting
to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from other
packaging and distribution systems.

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

*    What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
     before this gets merged?
*    What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the
     implementation of this feature before stabilization?
*    What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could
     be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out
     of this RFC?

# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be
and how it would affect the ecosystem and project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project and ecosystem in your proposal.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.

If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.

Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.
